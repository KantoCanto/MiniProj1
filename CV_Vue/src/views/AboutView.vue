        <p>
          Ever since I was a kid, I've had interest in techonology as a hole.<br />Video
          Games were a very big part of my childhood, and they are still present
          in my day-to-day life.<br />
          Watching movies, shows, anime and listening to music, were also ways
          I'd spend my free time.<br />
          Those were some of the reasons why I ended up enrolling in a
          Bachelor's Degree in Communication and Multimedia, where I got the
          chance to work on various areas such as Photography, Design and web
          Development.
          <br />For my curricular intership, I stayed at a Virtual Reality
          Laboratory, where I got the chance to familiarize myself with that
          technology. <br />
          Not feeling ready to end my academic studies and join the working
          life, I decided to take on the challenge of getting a Master's Degree.
          Following the area I'd spent my last 3 years, I enroled in Multimedia
          Technologies.<br />
          The first year was very eventful, and I even dabbled on Animation, an
          area that had always fascinated me.<br />
          This brings us to the present, where I finally chose what to persue as
          a carrier. Here begins my journey as a <strong>Web Developer</strong>.
